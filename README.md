# QLaw

A Flutter quiz app

## Getting Started

This prroject is focusing on creating small quiz application for students of Law faculty to help them learn and prepare for their exams.

## About

Project itself has mainly educational reason. I have previously started to write this app in Swift, but after announcment of Flutter, i completeli rebuild it into flutter.
Application is solely created for getting the beggining grasp of Flutter framework and learn with it. Project is on its start right now, and only the menu, quiz and results screens are done, but not completed. 

## Main Idea

Idea behind the application is to combine the learning and playing phase into one. Each player will level up through completing quizes. In futere there should be Highscores and shops for ingame currency that are obtained by participating in quiz. 

## Architecture

Application is not written in any specific architecture, although I am interested in BloC and probably will spaw onto it later in the project.
